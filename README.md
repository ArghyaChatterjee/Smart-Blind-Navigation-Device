# Smart Blind Navigation Device

# Introduction
It's a low cost and light weight navigation device for blind people which is worn in hand. One needs a sonar sensor, an arduino uno, a vibrating motor, and a battery to run the device.

# Working Principle
As soon as a blind people approach any obstacle, the device will start to give signal by increasing or decreasing motor vibration and the blind person will feel the vibration in hand accordingly.<be

# Execute the Code
Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/ArghyaChatterjee/Smart-Blind-Navigation-Device.git
```
Connect the PWM Pins of the Arduino UNO correctly with the output of the vibrating motor, the sonar sensor, and the battery.

Upload the code to the Arduino and see the sensor and the motor in action.
