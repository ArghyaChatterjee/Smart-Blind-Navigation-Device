# Smart-Blind-Navigation-with-Arduino-Sonar-Sensor-and-Motor-control
  1. It's a low cost and light weight navigation device for blind people which is worn in hand.<br />
  2. As soon as a blind people approach any obstacle, the device will start to give signal by increasing or decreasing motor        vibration and the blind person will feel the vibration in hand accordingly.<br />
  3. One needs a sonar sensor, an arduino uno and a vibrating motor to run the project.<br />
  4. Please see the code to connect to the defined pwm pins with output vibrating motor.<br />
